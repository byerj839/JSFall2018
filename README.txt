This program lets the user input a birthday or sun sign and gives them:
• Their daily horoscope pulled from the aztro API, found here https://aztro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
• A moodboard of images that relates to their sign, their compatible sign, lucky color, lucky number, mood for that day. 
  This data to find the images is also pulled from the aztro api, and then searches the keyword in the Unsplash API for a 
  random image with that keyword.
